This project entails carrying out customer personality analysis by performing supervised and unsupervised machine learning models. The main objective of the project was to design two models as follows: -

1: Customer segmentation (unsupervised learning) using the KMeans Clustering method.

2: A classification model (supervised learning) to determine whether customers will purchase the companyâ€™s product or not.
Generally, this report outlines the dataset used, the methodology employed, and the steps for training and evaluation, and provides an in-depth analysis of the model's performance and its potential applications.
